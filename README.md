# gogoci

A local/self hosted CI service for Go development, test, coverage, static analysis in one box

## Motivation

- Run CI locally so folks won't know you forgot to initialize map again and broke the test
- Replacement for legacy enterprise CI systems (a.k.a outdated customized Jenkins)

Why not Drone, Gitlab CI etc.

- Only focus on Go, include Go specific coverage, static analysis out of the box

## About
